My little game project to learn and better understand Javascript coding algorithms.

### GAMEPLAY

* To start the game, just press on any button on your keyboard.
* Press the "SPACE" button to jump the Dino over the obstacles to keep the game going.
* As soon as the Dino hits the obstacle (the cactus), it's GAME OVER!
* Note: the game speeds up after every 100 points gained so buckle up and see how much you can score as the game gets faster and faster! Enjoy!
